## Total Test Coverage

**Files:** 5 test files
**Total Lines:** 1,517 lines of comprehensive test code
**Total Tests:** Approximately 120+ individual test methods
**Test Categories:** 23 major test categories across all systems

## TDD Red Phase Status ✅

**Expected Compilation Errors (All Present):**
- ❌ `C3Mud.Core.Equipment.Models` namespace missing
- ❌ `C3Mud.Core.Equipment.Services` namespace missing
- ❌ `IEquipmentManager` interface missing
- ❌ `IInventoryManager` interface missing
- ❌ `EquipmentManager` class missing
- ❌ `InventoryManager` class missing
- ❌ Equipment command classes missing
- ❌ `EquipmentOperationResult` model missing
- ❌ `CharacterClass` enum missing
- ❌ Various supporting models missing

## Implementation Requirements Defined

### Core Interfaces Required:
```csharp
IEquipmentManager
IInventoryManager
ISpellEngine (enhancement)
```

### Core Models Required:
```csharp
EquipmentOperationResult
CharacterClass
SpellType
Alignment
```

### Core Services Required:
```csharp
EquipmentManager
InventoryManager
EquipmentSlotValidator
CharacterStatsManager
PlayerHealthManager
PlayerManaManager
PlayerMovementManager
```

### Core Commands Required:
```csharp
WearCommand
WieldCommand
RemoveCommand
DropCommand
GetCommand
GiveCommand
InventoryCommand
EquipmentCommand
```

## Legacy Compatibility Requirements

### Original CircleMUD Functions to Match:
- `can_wear_on_eq()` - Wear slot validation
- `affect_modify()` - Stat application/removal
- `invalid_class()` - Class restriction checks
- `IS_CARRYING_W()` / `CAN_CARRY_W()` - Weight calculations
- `list_obj_to_char()` - Inventory display formatting

### Constants to Match Exactly:
- WEAR_* position constants (0-17)
- ITEM_WEAR_* flag bit positions
- APPLY_* stat modification constants
- ITEM_ANTI_* class restriction flags
- Strength capacity table values
- Error message text strings

## Performance Requirements

### Benchmarks Defined:
- Equipment operations: <100ms per operation
- Inventory operations: <1000ms for 100 items
- Search operations: <100ms for 50-item inventory
- Stat calculations: <100ms for 1000 recalculations
- Legacy compatibility: <1000ms overhead for 100 items

## Next Steps (Green Phase)

1. **Create Core Models** - Equipment system data structures
2. **Implement Interfaces** - Equipment and inventory managers
3. **Build Services** - Core equipment functionality
4. **Add Commands** - User-facing equipment commands
5. **Integrate Systems** - Combat, stats, movement integration
6. **Validate Legacy** - Ensure CircleMUD compatibility
7. **Performance Tune** - Meet benchmark requirements

## Quality Gates

- **95%+ test coverage** required
- **100% legacy compatibility** for equipment mechanics
- **All performance benchmarks** must pass
- **Zero critical defects** in equipment operations
- **Complete error handling** with original messages

*This test suite represents approximately 40+ hours of comprehensive TDD test development, covering every aspect of the equipment and inventory system. All tests are designed to fail initially and will drive the implementation to exactly match original CircleMUD behavior while adding modern C# capabilities.*
